Mapping of the CBSA Codes to Urban Influence Codes. 

CBSA Code, core-based statistical area, is a U.S. geographic area defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that consists of one or more counties (or equivalents) anchored by an urban center of at least 10,000 people plus adjacent counties that are socioeconomically tied to the urban center by commuting.

Urban Influence Codes form a classification scheme that distinguishes metropolitan counties by population size of their metro area, and nonmetropolitan counties by size of the largest city or town and proximity to metro and micropolitan areas, subdivided into two metro and 10 nonmetro categories, resulting in a 12-part county classification.
