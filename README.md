# CSX415 Project: Assigning Credit Limits to New Accounts

## Overview

Purpose of this project is to examine if a model can be developed to assist jewelry manufacturers with assesing the credit risk of a potential new customer (retailer) and help the manufacturer assign a credit limit for that new customer.

## Project Files

This project uses ProjectTemplate and the project assets are stored acording to the ProjectTemplate folder structure.

Running the following commands will load and munge the necessary data to run the project and make a certain set of helper functions available for use. Each `.Rmd` file already calls the following two lines so this is not a requred step.

``` r
library('ProjectTemplate')
load.project()
```

Following documents will provide additional information about the project and the artifacts:

* `ASSETS.md` information about the project data, code, and reports  
* `deploy/README.md` about how you can install different components of the project including the standalone web application and the model package.
